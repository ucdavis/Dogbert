# Welcome to the Dogbert Project Management System.

## Note: this project is no longer being actively used or maintained as of 2014

Use Dogbert to manage project priorities, requirements engineering and manage your IT projects. This tool will help managers prioritize their workgroup's projects and allows aids in managing projects that span workgroups. Dogbert will help staff manage projects that they are working on and provide easy documentation on projects. It is open to all UC Davis employees with a valid Kerberos account.

Dogbert has been used extensively on software projects for requirements engineering, use case tracking and document generation by the College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences Dean's Office Computing Resources Unit.
